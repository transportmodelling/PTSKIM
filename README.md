# PTSKIM

A frequency based transit [skimming](https://tfresource.org/topics/Skim_Matrix.html) and [assignment](https://tfresource.org/topics/Network_assignment.html) model, based on the article:

Gentile, G., Nguyen, S., Pallottino, S. (2005). Route choice on transit networks with online information at stops. Transportation Science 39 (3), 289â€“297

for the case of deterministic headways.

The model allows for strict capacity constraints and crowding modelling according to the article:

Wardman, M., G.A. Whelan (2011). 20 Years or railway crowding valuation studies: evidence and lessons from British experience.Transport Reviews, 31, 379-398.

PTSKIM is a console application that reads its settings from a [control file](https://github.com/transportmodelling/PTSKIM/wiki/Control-file) that is passed as a command line argument.
